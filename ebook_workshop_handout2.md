# Ebooks: What do we care (for)? #
## Session 2: What do we care? ##

The purpose of this session is to put the significant properties we brainstormed in Session 1 into the context of the British Library and prioritise them in line with British Library business needs.

### 1. Telling Stories (or He do the Police in Different Voices) ###
For each of the significant property, identify the business needs by putting that feature into a short sentence of the form:

----

**As** The British Library
  
**We need** to preserve _ _ _ _insert property_ _ _ _
 
**So that** _ _ _ _insert business requirement/reason_ _ _ _

----

For example:

**As** The British Library
  
**We need** to preserve the defined chapter structure of a book
 
**So that** we can represent that book to readers accurately at a later date

----

Always ensure that the **so that** section is relevant to the British Library. For example does the British Library currently preserve all the annotations ever made about a book? Should it now these are digital?

### 2. Priorities ###
If time, having created your list of stories, please put them in order of importance where 1 is most important and work from there.
