# Ebooks: What do we care (for)? #
## Ebook Readers ##

Each the devices has the mostly same set of books on them. Where possible they share the same files too and this means you may not be able to open some files on some of the devices. This is deliberate!

### iOS devices - iPad & iPad mini ###
iBooks, Kindle, BlueFire and Adobe reader installed.

Same set of books added to each application – compare the books on each of the reading software and note differences.

Try opening one of the PDFs (Scientific papers prefixed DM_) in BlueFire & Kindle.

### Kindle Fire ###
Uses the native Kindle application. It has been difficult to add alternative ebook reading software to this device.

However, has the APK (APP) version of Data Analysis. Does this differ from the other rendering software?

### Kindle Keyboard ###

An e-ink device and interesting to compare with the functionality and presentation of the tablets.

### Elonex Ebook 

An curious antique and one that shows promise on the outside, but try turning a page. This one is interesting as it states that it is the ebook.

### Sony 505 ###

This is my favourite reader - it is lovely to look at, came with a case, expandable memory (necessary when it only has 198MB to play with) and has a e-ink screen not unlike modern ebook readers.

However, it has one major flaw.

### Nook HD ###
Again, the same set of books.

Try opening all of them and see what happens. What does this suggest about DRM?

Opening those same books on the Fire gives a different, less helpful error.

### All devices ###
Compare/contrast the various types of ebook – the older e-paper devices against the tablets, etc.

Nb. How copies of The Waste Land can be manipulated – moving line breaks, etc.
