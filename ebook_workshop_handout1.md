# Ebooks: What do we care (for)? #
## Session 1: Hands-On & Brainstorm ##

The purpose of this session is to create a list of significant properties for ebooks based on your experience and knowledge of the British Library and its collections.

You will be given the opportunity to explore several different ebooks, both fiction and non-fiction, across a range of different devices, reader software and devices.

Make a note of what you think is important as we will have a brainstorming session at the end to create a list of significant properties.

You may like to consider the following questions:

* What needs to be preserved in a book?
* How is an ebook different to a book?
* How are ebooks and books the same?
* What is different about the different reading devices?
* What is different about the different formats? (Kindle -vs- iBook for example).

You have 20 minutes to have some fun with these devices and then we'll report back.

## Significant property? ##
Significant properties are "essential attributes of a digital object which affect its appearance, behaviour, quality and usabilityâ€¦[that] must be preserved over time for the object to remain accessible and meaningful."

Some things are more important than others and that is usually a subjective judgement. We will explore which features are more important in the context of the British Library in Session 2.
